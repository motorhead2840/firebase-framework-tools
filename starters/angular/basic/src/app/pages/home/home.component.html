    <h2>Server Side Rendering (SSR)</h2>
    <p>Dynamic content is generated by the server running on Cloud Functions. Improve performance, SEO and achieve better Core Web Vitals results.
      Visit <a href="ssr">/ssr</a> to see Angular SSR in action.</p>

    <h2>Prerendering (SSG)</h2>
    <p>Prerendering maintains the same performance benefits of server-side rendering (SSR) but achieves a reduced Time to First Byte (TTFB),
      ultimately enhancing user experience. The key distinction lies in an approach where pages are served as static content, and there is no request-based rendering.
      Visit <a href="ssg">/ssg</a> page to see a statically generated page served by Firebase App Hosting.</p>

    <h2>WTF AM I DOING?</h2>
  <p>I was on tour with Hawkwind in 1974, we were staying at the Riot House and Roy Wood and Wizzard were also in town. 
    I got this urge to write a song in the middle of the night. I ran downstairs to the Wizzard room, got Roy's Ovation acoustic guitar, then hurried back to mine. 
    I went on to the balcony and howled away for four hours. Cars were stopping and the drivers were listening then driving off, 
    and there I was yelling away at the top of my voice." - Lemmy.

    <h2>Deferrable Views</h2>
    <p>
      Take advantage of one of the most important features of Angular from recent releases.
      Deferrable views are a powerful tool that can be used to reduce the initial bundle size of your application or defer heavy components that may not be loaded until a later time.
      Visit <a routerLink="deferrable-views">/defer</a> page to see defer in action.
